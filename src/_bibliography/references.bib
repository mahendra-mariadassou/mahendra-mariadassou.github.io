    abstract = {Author summary Genome-scale metabolic models describe an organism’s metabolism. Building good models requires the integration of all relevant available information, obtained by exploring different data types and biological databases. This process is not straightforward and choices are made along the way, for example, which data is analyzed, with what tools. It matters that all reconstruction steps are well documented so that models can be fully exploited by the community. Having this metadata allows other researchers to reproduce, improve or reuse a model as a blueprint to create new ones. Sadly, this information is usually scattered and its proper distribution is the exception rather than the norm when using “à la carte” pipelines that combine main platforms and individual tools. We created a platform for “à la carte” metabolic model generation that responds to the need of transparency and data-connection in the field. It includes a battery of tools to exploit heterogeneous data through customizable pipelines. At each step, relevant information is stored, ensuring reproducibility and documentation of processes. Furthermore, exploration of models and metadata during the reconstruction process is facilitated through the automatic generation of local wikis. This view offers a user-friendly solution to iteratively explore genome-scale metabolic models produced with personalized pipelines and poorly interoperable tools. We highlight these benefits by building models for organisms with various input data. Among them, we show why the combination of heterogeneous information is necessary to elucidate specificities of Tisochrysis lutea, a eukaryotic microalga, for anti-oxidant production.},

	title = {The genome of Ectocarpus subulatus highlights unique mechanisms for stress tolerance in brown algae},
	year = {2018},
	doi = {10.1101/307165},
	publisher = {Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory},
	abstract = {Brown algae are multicellular photosynthetic organisms belonging to the stramenopile lineage. They are successful colonizers of marine rocky shores world-wide. The genus Ectocarpus, and especially strain Ec32, has been established as a genetic and genomic model for brown algae. A related species, Ectocarpus subulatus Kuetzing, is characterized by its high tolerance of abiotic stress. Here we present the genome and metabolic network of a haploid male strain of E. subulatus, establishing it as a comparative model to study the genomic bases of stress tolerance in Ectocarpus. Our analyses indicate that E. subulatus has separated from Ectocarpus sp. Ec32 via allopatric speciation. Since this event, its genome has been shaped by the activity of viruses and large retrotransposons, which in the case of chlorophyll-binding proteins, may be related to the expansion of this gene family. We have identified a number of further genes that we suspect to contribute to stress tolerance in E. subulatus, including an expanded family of heat shock proteins, the reduction of genes involved in the production of halogenated defense compounds, and the presence of fewer cell wall polysaccharide-modifying enzymes. However, 96\% of genes that differed between the two examined Ectocarpus species, as well as 90\% of genes under positive selection, were found to be lineage-specific and encode proteins of unknown function. This underlines the uniqueness of brown algae with respect to their stress tolerance mechanisms as well as the significance of establishing E. subulatus as a comparative model for future functional studies.},
