    I use logic programming to study the metabolism of non-model organisms: facilitate the refinement of metabolic networks, propose solution to select communities of interest within microbiotas.

    I focus my research on graph-based or hybrid (graph-based and constraint-based) modeling of metabolism based on <a href="https://potassco.org/" target="_blank">Answer Set Programming ↗</a> and the solving of combinatorial problems. I contributed to the <a href="https://github.com/bioasp/meneco" target="_blank">meneco ↗</a> project, a tool dedicated to <b> gap-fill genome-scale metablic networks </b> by selecting a minimal number of reactions from a database, in order to ensure the producibility of compounds of interest (<i>PLOS Computational Biology 2017</i>). I then collaborated to the creation of a <b>hybrid</b> method for metabolism gap-filling, enabling to optimize not only the constraint-based producibility of metabolites, but also the reaction of interest with the Flux Balance Analysis framework (<i>LPNMR Conference 2017, best Student Paper</i>). I now focus on the <b> selection of minimal communities </b> within microbiotas.
