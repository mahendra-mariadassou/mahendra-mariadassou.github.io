     I am mainly interested in evolutionary genomics with a special interest in robust phylogenetic inferrence, outlier detection in evolutionary studies (rogue taxa/influent sites), phylogenetic comparative methods. I'm also interested in metagenomics, with a special interest in statistical models for multivariate count data, such as encountered in metagenomics studies.
