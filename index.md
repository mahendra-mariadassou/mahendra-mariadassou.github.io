I am a researcher in statistics applied to evolutionnary and comparative biology, with a strong interest in phylogenetics and metagenomics. I work at [INRA](www.inra.fr), in the department [MIA]() and belong to [MaIAGE](maiage.jouy.inra.fr) laboratory, located in the pastoral city of Jouy-en-Josas. 

During my PhD, I visited [Cécile Ané](http://www.stat.wisc.edu/~ane/)
at the [University of Wisconsin - Madison](http://www.wisc.edu/)
thanks to a Fulbright fellowship.
During my stay, I have been working in the [Sytsma Lab](http://www.botany.wisc.edu/sytsma/SytsmaLab/Welcome.html).
